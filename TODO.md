# TODO

* Why do new boards show up off-center in production (but not in development)?

* Fix 'blur'-- hide form-- behavior.

* Add ability to share boards with users, allow other users to edit boards.

* Users can have friends? Or at least search for other users? When users share boards, use type-ahead to fill in the username.
